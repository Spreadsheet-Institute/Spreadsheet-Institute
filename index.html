        <p class="centered">Spreadsheet Institute embodies a collaborative effort to seek, test, and break the boundaries of what can be accomplished by present & future spreadsheet technologies. Whether optimizing for performance, readability, extensibility, or aesthetics, our aim is to restore the spreadsheet experience from one of pain to pleasure, from the intellectually tedious to the intellectually tantalizing, and from repetitive to the revolutionary.</p>
